# desk_com

log parser for desk com code test.

Want to encode the unittest, but this script is very simple and there is no class in the script. 
Skip unittest for this one.

Coded with validation on record parser, to filtered out invalid field such as invalid datetime. Finally decided to
remove validator and leave it show up unless we want a clean data used in database in the future.
